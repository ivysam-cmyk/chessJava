_methods of classes_

**pieces.pawn and other pieces**
move()
kill()
die()

<u> Areas of improvement</u>
Make a move class and every piece will extend it accordingly - this is not possible

[ ] make a class where qn asks each player alternately, then the player chooses which pos/(piece type) to move
