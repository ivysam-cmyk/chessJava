**TODO**
make sure to make a function that takes the initPos and finalPos and returns useful values like num of moves in each direc etc and return a dict/array/arraylist 

[x] the number of moves recorded per piece should not reset every time obj is created but per pieceString

[x] when pop(), differentiate the pieces based on caps, p2 will be caps
